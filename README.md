## Study Mode

Study Mode allows you to choose questions from seven premade categories or create your own.

*Categories* are guidelines for picking questions. When playing with a set of questions from a category, the questions will be chosen randomly from the pool of questions available to that category. Selecting a category or creating a new one opens a dialog where you can (in addition to changing the category's name and starting a set of questions) adjust the relative weights of different types of questions. For instance, creating a category with a 1 next to Business Jargon and a 3 next to Parliamentary Procedures will make Parliamentary Procedures questions show up three times as often as Business Jargon questions in sets of questions from that category. 

Starting a new set from the category edit dialog will prompt you to select how many questions to play. Answering a question is as simple as tapping one of the options (it will be highlighted in red if incorrect, and the correct one in green). You can move on by tapping the arrow button or swiping to the right, even if a question has not been answered yet. 

## Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Features

Tapping the exclamation mark on the main menu screen brings up a dialog you can use to send us feedback - bug reports, question suggestions, or anything interesting you'd like us to see. When submitting a bug report, we'd appreciate some system information to effectively diagnose the issue.

## Privacy

We are committed to ensuring your security and anonymity and will not ask for or retrieve any identifying information in the background of the app.

# FAQ

## Why "Fabula"?

FBLA is more than a set of questions can possibly teach anyone. The word _fabula_ is originally a term in the study of literature that refers to the raw material of a story. Similarly, we aim to make it fun for the user to learn about the facts of FBLA, or business, or investing - the "raw material". We acknowledge that these things cannot possibly describe all of the FBLA story. But, we hope that knowing more about them will make it so much easier and more exciting to find out those things that cannot be quantified, objectively known, or even seen: culture, community, and so on...

## When is multiplayer coming?

We hope to add a polished multiplayer mode alongside our introduction of Fabula to the Google Play Store. 

## What else is planned?

Some ideas we have tossed around are:
* Running a companion website to display questions and scores for large-group games;
* Storing questions in a database in order to update your phone's list of questions in real time as we add them;
* Associating categories and statistics with secure accounts to allow users to play on multiple devices.
